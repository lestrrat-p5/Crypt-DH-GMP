0.00011 - 07 Sep 2013
    - Make generate_keys way more random by using Perl_seed
      (reported by karupanerura).
      Upgrade is strongly advised for anybody using Crypt::DH::GMP (and hence
      Net::OpenID::Consumer)

0.00010 - 17 Nov 2011
    - Split CCFLAGS and LFLAGS into words (rt #72464)
    - Fix t/02_binhack.t to work with modern Net::OpenID::Consumer
    - Don't rely on hardcoded size_t

0.00009 - 02 Jul 2010
  - No code change
  - Tweak Makefile.PL to work better with MacPorts (with or without it)

0.00008 - 11 May 2010
  - Use Test::Requires in tests
  - Update docs
  - Update benchmark results

0.00007 - 11 May 2010
  - Modernize file layout

0.00006 - 05 Feb 2010

    complement in binary form

0.00004 - 23 Apr 2008

0.00003 - 15 Apr 2008
  - Make g() and p() both getter /and/ setter
  - Properly initialize priv_key if nothing was given in the constructor
    (Net::SSH::Perl uses Crypt::DH this way)

  - Fix t/99-compat.t so that it properly detectes Crypt::DH
